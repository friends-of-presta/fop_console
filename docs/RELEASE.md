Releasing is easy.

- on the `dev` branch, upgrade the `version` value of the module.
- make a pull request, this will open discussion with other to ensure we are ready to do it.
- when done, on github, go to [release page](https://github.com/friends-of-presta/fop_console/releases) : click on the pen on the current Draft.
- add a release title (the release number at the moment)
- cleanup the release contents
- click on 'publish release'
- done
