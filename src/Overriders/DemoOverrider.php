 * This is a demo Overrider.
 * It does nothing but serve as example.
 *
 * It handles files (passed as command argument).
 * If it contains 'README.md' the overrider will handle the override.
 * It means it is supposed to do something while this file is passed as argument.
 * So it declare it will process setting $this->handled to true.
 *
 * @todo Maybe not the best way to declare it is concerned.
 * Otherwise the Overrider declares not to handle this file (do not touch $this->handled.
 *
 * If file name also contains 'success', the overrider pretend to succeed.
 * Else it fails (throw an Exception).
